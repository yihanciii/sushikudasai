# SafePath — Crime-Aware Routing System

A Manhattan-focused routing engine that improves walking safety by leveraging
real-time crime, crash, and CCTV dataset integration.

This project is built for academic purposes to demonstrate practical use of:
- Spatial ETL & feature engineering
- Geospatial network modeling using OSMnx & NetworkX
- Crime risk scoring based on multi-source data
- Routing optimization for safer navigation
- PostGIS + MongoDB geolocation database design

## Project Features

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Data Cleaning | Normalize coordinates, remove invalid records, keep Manhattan-only samples over recent 3 years |
| Street Graph | Road network built from OSM (walkable edges) |
| Risk Modeling | Calculate weighted risk score using crime, crashes, missing CCTV |
| Routing API | Flask API returning safest path using risk-weighted Dijkstra |
| User Reports | MongoDB storing community-reported incidents |
